## How to Use the Prototype

Open the Figma link above and click “Present” in the top right corner.  
All interactions are clickable. You can move through the screens by tapping buttons just like on a phone.

This prototype is designed for an iPhone screen layout. It works best on a laptop or desktop browser in full screen.



## What the App Is

ClimbSpace is made for indoor climbers who get stuck on a route and want beta that fits their body and style.

In the gym, people usually check beta between attempts, so the flow needs to be quick and easy to understand.

This prototype shows:

- browsing community betas in a gym  
- generating a personalized beta  
- following a step-by-step guided beta  


## Tasks Included

### Task 1 (Simple): Find and watch a community beta

- Start from the Home screen.  
- Select a gym.  
- Open one of the community betas.  
- Watch the beta video.

The task is complete once the beta is playing.


### Task 2 (Moderate): Generate a personalized beta

- From the Home screen, tap the option to start a new beta.  
- Upload or take a photo of the route.  
- Select holds.  
- Enter body information (height, wingspan, level, current injuries).  
- Confirm and wait for the loading screen.  
- View the generated beta.

The task is complete when the generated beta screen appears.


### Task 3 (Complex): Follow the guided beta mode

- From the generated beta screen, tap “Start Climbing.”  
- Move through the steps using the next/previous buttons.  
- Voice guidance is optional and can be turned on or off.  
- Exit the session when finished.

The task is complete once the user goes through the guided steps and exits successfully.


## Tools Used

We built this prototype in Figma.

Figma made it easy to connect screens and quickly adjust layouts after feedback.  


## Hard-Coded Elements

Some parts of this prototype are simulated:

- The gym list is a small fixed set of example gyms.
- Community betas are sample entries.
- The AI beta result is pre-made.
- Body profile inputs do not actually change the output.
- The loading screen is just a transition.
- Save/comment features do not store real data.

These are hard-coded because this is a design prototype, not a working app.


## Limitations

There is no real AI processing.  
There is no backend or database.  
There is no real computer vision for route detection.  
Voice guidance is shown in the interface but not actually functional.

The goal of this prototype is to demonstrate the user flow and interaction design rather than full technical implementation.
